    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>Is there a reason we would use a conditional over a ternary opperator? are they perfectly interchangable or is one better for certain cases than the other.</p>
    <p>Also how can I know I am doing well. How do I gauge how well I am doing at each assignment? Would it be if I am able to anwser all the questions with out using notes or the internet?</p>
